        "description_one": "Welcome to the website. If you&apos;re here, you&apos;re likely looking to find random words. Random Word Generator is the perfect tool to help you do this. While this tool isn&apos;t a word creator, it is a word generator that will generate random words for a variety of activities or uses. Even better, it allows you to adjust the parameters of the random words to best fit your needs. The first option the tool allows you to adjust is the number of random words to be generated. You can choose as many or as few as you&apos;d like. You also have the option of choosing words that only begin with a certain letter, only end with a certain letter or only begin and end with certain letters. If you leave these blank, the randomize words that appear will be from the complete list. You also have the option of choosing the number of syllables of the words or the word length of the randomized words. There are also options to further refine by choosing &quot;less than&quot; or &quot;greater than&quot; options for both syllables and word length. Again, if you leave the space blank, the complete list of randomized words will be used. Finally, you can choose between standard text or cursive words. The cursive words will all be in cursive using Once you have input all of your specifications, all you have to do is to press the Generate Random Words button, and a list of random words will appear. Below are some of the common ways people use this tool. Games This tool can be useful for games like or MadLibs. Since the words are random, this helps to keep a game like Pictionary fair for all those playing. For a game like MadLibs, it can help kids improve their vocabulary by generating words they may not have ever considered to fill in the blank spaces. The tool has the potential to help with any word game that doesn&apos;t require a specific word.Creative Writing",

        "tech_basic_summery": "When thinking of computer graphics people will commonly imagine the high definition 3D models used in todays video games or even movies that look incredibly realistic its enough to trigger the uncanny valley phenomena. Computer graphics have come a long way in such a short amount of time and its really only been about 60 years since computer graphics were being actively improved and worked on. The first “graphics” started as punched cards. These were what were used to visually display information and it wasn’t even displayed on the computer screen. The computer would take the punch cards and read them, loading in the information. The way we see computer graphics now kicked off with the invention of an Oscilloscope. This is a machine that shows voltage data as waves. Ben Laposky was the one who created the connection between using an oscilloscope as computer graphics leading him to become one of the first computer artists. He saw the potential in having a visual representation of the data displayed on the screen. Ben Laposky himself said, “The relationship of the oscillons to computer art is that the basic waveforms are analogue curves, of the type used in analogue computer systems.” Laposky’s genius idea allowed him to set the stage for future computer graphic designers and started a chain reaction of the need to represent visual data on computers in an easy, readable way.
