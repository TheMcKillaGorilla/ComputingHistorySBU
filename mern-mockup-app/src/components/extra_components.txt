have to use fucntional component for the container since i use class pioneer extends component

questtions to ask
- regarding the mp4 videos on the drie how do i get the embeded link?
- how to access the png images from the drive, do i have to download them and save it to a folder in the public file?


pioneers page with meterial-ui
- plan to have 3 main commplex grids
    - the (left)first grid will have a card view wich will have the pioneed video and description page
    - the (right)seccond grid will have multiple compex grids in a nested grid, each having the playlist themed list of pioneer videos.
    - the (bottom)third grid will be a complex frid which will have the pioneer of the day


rule 
- student who use video content in webpages all video conent is from yt
- i have to find the image and specify the dimenstion
    - we can crop the images, not scaling -> we can scale if the x and y are same scale
        - we can also define the aspect ratio ex: 3:5
- for the technology there should be a directory in the public file for everything which will be seperated into each different technology
- student zip the project and submit
- we open it and then save it into the directory without having to move stuff around


for saving json object
- can useState or props 
- 

debugging 
- create breakproints in google chrome to be able to find the bug for the technology page 


toDO:
- create abstract for the project ~ 300 words https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/ureca/celebration/registration.php
- create a pdf poster file
