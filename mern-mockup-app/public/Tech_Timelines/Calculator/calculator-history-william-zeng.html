<h1>Four key milestones in the history of the calculator:
    <h2>The first calculators were mechanical:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Abacus was first used in 2000 BC</li>
        <li>The Slide Rule was invented in the 17th century by William Oughtred, and used the sum and difference of logs to divide and subtract faster (used until 1980s).</li>
        <li>Wilhelm Schickard invents the first “adding machine” in 1623 (not popular until the 1850s).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The next ones were electronic, and used vacuum tubes/transistors:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>IBM unveils the IBM 604, the first mass produced electronic calculator in 1948 (used vacuum tubes).</li>
        <li>IBM obsoletes the 604 with the IBM 608, a calculator that used transistors instead of vacuum tubes in 1957.</li>
        <li>Texas instruments released the “Cal Tech”, a computer that can do all four arithmetic operations while being handheld in 1967.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>These gave way to microchip based calculators:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Large Scale Integration semiconductor development intersects with calculators, Sharp and Rockwell develop QT-8D Micro Compet that uses integrated circuits in 1969.</li>
        <li>Busicom makes it even smaller in 1970, with the Mostek MK6010 having all four functions on a single chip.</li>
        <li>Busicom was also developing some desktop calculators with Intel, using the 4004 microprocessor in 1971. Calculators continue to become smaller.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Finally, there were virtual calculators:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The IBM Simon personal communicator contains a calculator in 1993.</li>
        <li>The first Apple Iphone was released in 2007. It and many other phones of its time had calculators.</li>
        <li>Calculators are still around, because of school and professional use.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The evolution of the calculator follows a similar path as the evolution of the computer. It starts from the mechanical, which range from simple like the abacus, to complex geared devices. We will look at the development of the calculator, from 2000 BC to 2021 AD. As we go through the innovators of the time period, we will address the problems it solved, as well as how it evolved. We will also look at some themes in human history with regards to development.

<h2>The Abacus</h2>
<img src="abacus.png">
<p>The abacus was a device that used rods and sliding beads to count faster. When humans count, we are often able to do large sums in our heads, but keeping track of all the numbers is hard. We have a finite working memory, which grows with practice, but is still limited by our natural capacity. The abacus allowed humans to offload some of this computation onto the world. We can use the rows of the abacus to represent powers of ten, with the first index being one to ten, the next index being ten to one hundred, the third index being one hundred to one thousand, etc. This helped with the speed and accuracy of computations in markets and accounting.</p>
<h2>The Slide Rule</h2>
<img src="sliderule.png">
<p>The slide rule did not supersede the abacus, but supplemented it with the power of logarithms. In the 1600s, as mathematicians discovered logarithms, William Oughtred developed the slide rule. We know that the log of the product of two numbers is the sum of their logs, and the division is the difference. Using a slide rule, we are able to multiply and divide large numbers quickly. This was something that the abacus could not do as easily, and another example of man and machine cooperating. The natural limits of the human mind can be exceeded with devices.</p>
<h2>mechanical Calculators</h2>
<img src="addingmachine.png">
<p>Mechanical calculators were developed very early, with Wilhelm Schickard creating the “adding machine” in 1623. This was right after the slide rule was invented, so why was it not widely used? This is a common thread between computing and calculators. At our core, humans love simplicity and compactness. As the computer and calculator became smaller, it was more widely distributed and used. The earliest calculators were simply too big and complex for the public to use. The simple slide rule and abacus would dominate for another two centuries, until mechanical calculators were popularized. It would be remiss to not mention the difference engine, which used the method of finite differences to write the output of polynomials. Many of these developments used math to help perform calculations faster such as the slide rule and difference engine.

<h2>Electronic Calculators</h2>
<img src="ibm604.png">
<p>Electronic calculators were developed in line with computers, as the concept of personal computers wasn’t developed until much later. One of the first electronic calculators was the IBM 604, which still used vacuum tubes. It was useful for business, as people performed calculations for all manner of reasons. It could be used to calculate a loan, check balance sheets, and add up sales. The 604 could be rented for $645 per month in 1948 dollars(~$6,926 as of Jan 2021). The IBM 608 later came out, which used solid state transistors over vacuum tubes. It could perform “4,500 additions per second”. These calculators later decreased in size as the Texas Instruments “Cal Tech” was created, which still used transistors, but was handheld. Across time, we see a trend of other inventions being added to the calculator, making it more usable and more efficient.</p>
<h2>Microchip Based Calculators</h2>
<p>As computers began to be developed, the calculator also decreased in size and increased in power. Many of the semiconductor businesses in the US collaborated with Japanese firms to create integrated circuit based calculators. This collaboration represents a continuity across technology, as groups work together to integrate different parts, creating a better product. In the years 1969 to 1971, calculators with microchips became smaller and smaller, using fewer microchips. Intel notably created the 4004 microprocessor for Busicom, but was able to keep the rights to the processor. This would help spur the development of computing.</p>
<h2>Modern Day Calculators</h2>
<p>Nearly every phone in the 2010s has a calculator installed as an app or native software. Our computers are easily capable of performing calculations that were impossible 50 years ago. The speed and efficiency of our technology has increased exponentially. As the smartphone became ubiquitous in American society, sales of handheld and pocket calculators fell in exchange. Just as the pocket calculator replaced the slide rule in the 1980s, smartphones have nearly replaced the pocket calculator. Some uses today are as specialized tools for work, cheating resistant test taking devices, and convenient tech. Calculators can be special tools for electricians and bank workers, as they can quickly calculate voltage or the payment of a mortgage. Calculators are common in math tests when teachers don’t want the students to have access to other resources. Calculators are also convenient to keep around, as you might want a customer in a store to see the calculation of their total payment. We’ll always have the need for calculators, and it will be exciting to see how future calculators operate.</p>
<h1>Reflection</h1>
<p>Overall, calculators are a component in a larger trend amongst technology. As humans became industrial and then digital people, calculators have followed. The need for computation and calculation has always been present. As we enter the next decade, man and machine will grow closer together. Similarly to books, calculators allow us to offload a critical task. As the human mind becomes increasingly free from the bounds it had before, we can reach new heights in creativity and productivity. The book allows us to store long term memories and instructions. The calculator allows us to relax our working memory, and allow analytical thinking to flow into other areas of our lives. When taking a physics test, it is much easier to determine the problem structure if the calculations are offloaded. Another trend in the history of calculators was the one of integration. As mathematicians developed laws, calculators used them to be more efficient. The abacus used the trick of operating in powers of ten. This allowed them to count and store digits up to the ten to the power of how many rows the abacus had. The slide rule made it possible to multiply numbers quickly using the sum of logs trick. The adding machine used the gears of the day, and it wasn’t until the machinery caught up that mechanical calculators became popular. As vacuum tubes and transistors became cheaply available, calculators that leveraged this technology were available to the public in turn. When microchips were popularized, the calculators rapidly integrated them and became handheld. When smartphones came out, the calculator was integrated into these as well. As humans become more advanced and are able to perceive the world in different ways, calculation will still be paramount for everyone.
    As a statistics major, I love calculations and data. One of the ways computers have shaped our lives is through machine learning. Using a large data set, we can find structure within the data and leverage this structure to make decisions quickly. These structures, once created, can behave similarly to a calculator in how quickly they offload our computation. We can predict the weather for tomorrow, or determine if an image is a cat or dog, or recommend a movie to someone. Machine learning systems represent the future of calculation, as once difficult decisions can be made quickly and easily. Everyone interacts with one of these “calculators”, and I’m excited to see how they will evolve!
