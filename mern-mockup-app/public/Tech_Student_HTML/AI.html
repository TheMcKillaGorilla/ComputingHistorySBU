<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial intelligence(AI) refers to the stimulation of human intelligence processed by machines. In simple terms, it is an effort to create machines that are capable of thinking like humans. The idea of artificial intelligence can be traced back to the ancient times. Vannevar Bush&rsquo;s &ldquo;As We May Think&rdquo; in 1945 certainly envisioned the future where computers can perform and assist humans in activities. The first step towards the start of artificial intelligence began in 1950 when Alan Turing developed the Turing Test. Alan Turing was a highly influential pioneer in the world of computing and contributed to the beginning of AI.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Alan Turing</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alan Turing was born on June 13, 1912 in London, United Kingdom. He was a philosopher, mathematician, codebreaker and a pioneer of computer science. He spent his childhood without his parents which shaped him to have a loner personality. He discovered that he was homosexual when he went to boarding school, Sherborne. He met Christopher Morcom with whom he formed an important friendship and described him as &ldquo;first love&rdquo;. He used to discuss mathematics and philosophy with Morcom. During his final year at Sherborne, Morcom died due to tuberculosis. After his death, Turing was inspired to learn more about quantum physics and advanced mathematics. He continued to study mathematics at King&rsquo;s College, Cambridge with a scholarship. He graduated with honors in 1934. He was working on one of the first computers when he created a theoretical machine. In 1936, he introduced a mathematical model of a computer which was known as the Turing machine. The Turing machine is an automation that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a finite table. This machine played a vital role in world war II. During the war, the machine was used to decrypt messages from Enigma which is a encryption machine used by German. Without the Turing machine, the outcome of the war was uncertain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alan Turing is known as one of the founding fathers of artificial intelligence. In 1950, Turing proposed a hypothetical theory called the Turing test. It was originally called &ldquo;The Imitation Game&rdquo;. The Turing test plays a significant role in the history of artificial intelligence. Turing wanted to test the machine's ability to think and how it distinguishes from humans. He argued a more practical way to assess a machine&rsquo;s intelligence is to test its ability to mimic human behavior equivalency, rather than seek to measure a computer's ability to think. A machine must be able to fool a human into thinking it is human according to the test. Through this Turing was proposing the operational definition of artificial intelligence. In the near future, other computer scientists also created their own programs to pass the Turing test. In 1965, Joseph Weizenbaum created the program called &ldquo;ELIZA&rdquo;. Eliza is a chatbot that holds conversations with humans. Eugene Goostman is a chatbot who participated in various competitions for the turing test. In 2014, in the Turing test competition at Royal Society, it became the first program to pass the test according to Kevin Warwick.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>John McCarthy</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John McCarthy was born on September 4, 1927 in Boston, Massachusetts. He was an American computer scientist pioneer, inventor and a cognitive scientist. As a child, he was exceptionally bright and graduated high school two years early. As a teen he was a genius in mathematics, so he taught himself mathematics by studying textbooks from California Institute of Technology(Caltech) managed to skip two years of mathematics and graduate from Caltech. He was heavily inspired by John von Neumann after attending his lecture at Caltech. McCarthy plays a pivotal role in computer programming and artificial intelligence. He is known as the father of artificial intelligence. In 1956, he moved to Dartmouth College. To bring together U.S. researchers interested in automata theory, neural nets, and the study of intelligence, McCarthy organized a two-month workshop at Dartmouth along with Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon, and Nathaniel Rochester. At the workshop, the term &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; was introduced for the first time by John McCarthy to explore ways of making machines like humans. The team was optimistic about AI&rsquo;s future. In the late 1950s, McCarthy created the programming language called Lisp based on lambda calculus to facilitate artificial intelligence research. Lisp became dominant in the AI industry for years to come.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Developments of Artificial Intelligence</strong></h1>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1900s</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first working AI program was Game AI which ran on the machine Ferranti Mark I at University of Manchester. Christopher Strachey wrote the checkers playing program in 1951 and Dietrich Prinz wrote the first chess playing program. In 1959, General Problem Solver(GPS) was an artificial intelligence program written by Herbert A. Simon, J. C. Shaw, and Allen Newell. It was designed from the start to imitate human problem-solving protocols. In 1960, Joseph Carl Robert Licklider published &ldquo;Man-Computer Symbiosis&rdquo;. He had a vision for interactive computing. He wanted to build something that allows humans and machines to work together to solve problems. In 1962, the first industrial robot Unimate was invented by George Devol and Joseph Engelberger. Unimate worked on General Motors by replacing humans on the assembly line. In 1969, Shakey the robot was developed under the leadership of Charles Rosen at the Artificial Intelligence Center of Stanford Research Institute funded by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(DARPA). Shakey the Robot was the first general purpose robot. It was replaced by Flakey the robot in 1985.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AI Winter</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the release of &ldquo;Perceptrons&rdquo;, a book by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert there was a lack of interest in artificial intelligence research. This period was called AI Winter. In the 1970s, DARPA held back from funding academic AI research. Sir James Lighthill evaluated AI research in the United Kingdom as per command by the UK Parliament. He released a report which is now called the Lighthall report and criticized the failures of AI and concluded that it is not likely to succeed in the future. In 1981, Japan announced the "Fifth Generation" project, a 10-year plan to build intelligent computers. Unlike Americans they used PROLOG as computer language for AI programming instead of LISP based programming language. The Artificial Intelligence industry started to rise again in the 1980s. In 1997, in a chess playing competition, IBM&rsquo;s Deep Blue which is a chess playing machine beat the chess champion Garry Kasparov. The development of Deep Blue started with a project named ChipTest built by Feng-hsiung Hsu, Thomas Ananatharaman and Murray Campbell at Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania in 1985. Late 1990s and early 2000&rsquo;s was the era of AI robots. In 1997, Cynthia Breazeal developed Kismet(robot) for her doctoral thesis at Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT) under Rodney Brooks. Kismet is an emotionally intelligent robot insofar as it detects and responds to people&rsquo;s feelings. In 1999, Japanese company Sony introduced Artificial Intelligence Robot(AIBO), robot pet dogs. The robot was designed to have personality&nbsp; and skills that develop over time. AIBO was invented in Sony&rsquo;s Computer Science Laboratory(CSL). There are a total of five generation models and their latest successor is QRIO(Quest for cuRIOsity) created in 2003.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2000s</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first mass produced robotic vacuum cleaner was invented by iRobot in 2002. iRobot was a company founded by 3 members of MIT&rsquo;s Artificial Intelligence Lab. Roomba has sensors to navigate steep stairs and clean floors. Microsoft launched its first wireless game for Xbox 360 in 2010. Kinect is a gaming device that interacts via gestures, voice commands and body motions. A huge breakthrough of artificial intelligence towards the future was the inventions of virtual assistant software. In 2011, Apple launched Siri, a virtual assistant with voice commands, gesture based controls and natural language user interface. Siri was developed at Stanford Research Center(SRI) International Artificial Intelligence Center. Google&rsquo;s Google Now was invented in 2012 and Microsoft&rsquo;s Cortana was invented in 2014. Amazon launched Alexa in 2014, an intelligent virtual assistant with a voice interface that completes shopping tasks. Deepmind is an independent artificial intelligence company and research laboratory founded by Dennis Hassabis, Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman in London, UK in 2010. It was acquired by Google in 2014. In 2015, Google&rsquo;s parent company Alphabet Inc. took full ownership. In 2017, AlphaGo claimed victory after beating the world champion Ke Jie in the complex board game of Go.</span> </strong></p>
